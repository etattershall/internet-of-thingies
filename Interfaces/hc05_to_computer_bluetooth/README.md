# HC-05 to computer

Code to connect from computer (PC or Raspberry Pi) running python to Arduino via bluetooth


## Requirements

- HC-05 set up on Arduino, key pin not shorted
- Python 3.4+ or Python 2.6+ (Runs with Python 3.5, but probably also with other versions)

## Before attempting to connect to a new device from Windows for the first time:

You need to go into 'Bluetooth settings', select the device you want to pair with and type in the passcode (default 1234).
