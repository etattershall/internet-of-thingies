##Connecting to STFC-Guest via Raspberry Pi

Normally, after connecting to STFC guest, you are redirected to a log on page on your web browser. However, this does not happen with the Raspberry Pi. To get the log on page, you need to attept to connect to a HTTP page (i.e. not a HTTPS page). Therefore, on your web browser, type 'http://www.bbc.co.uk'

Bizarre, but it works.
