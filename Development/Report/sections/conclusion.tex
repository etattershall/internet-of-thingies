We developed a prototype of an Internet of Things architecture for future testing of a security protocol. If applied to our main use case, a Smart Airport, our implementation of a distributed network would allow users to connect, share and receive data; interacting with a central broker through a Smart Agent according to their defined privacy level. We used the three core privacy specifications of mF2C and integrated them into an MQTT based API for use by the project in testing its use cases. STFC could benefit from our prototype if it was adapted for use as a distributed monitoring system for the facilities. Additionally, the inexpensive design - mainly using Raspberry Pis and Arduinos - makes this setup applicable to outreach events where Edge Devices can be distributed amongst visitors/students, uniquely involving them in data collection.
