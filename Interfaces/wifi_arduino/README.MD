## ScanForNetworks
An arduino sketch to print the MAC address of the wifi shield and then print all reachable networks.

Only slightly adapted from the tutorial -> prints the names of the encryption types rather than a byte.
## WPAConnection
Connect to a given network by supplying an SSID and a password (copied directly from the tutorial)
